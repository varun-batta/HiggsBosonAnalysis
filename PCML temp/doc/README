You can obtain our final classification results by running the run.py file. To
avoid having to wait ~1h to get the results, we have commented out the gradient
descent function and provide you with the resulting "w_star" model obtained.

If you wish to verify the implementation, feel free to comment out the provided
"w_star" model parameters and to uncomment the gradient descent function.
